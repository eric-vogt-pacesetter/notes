# notes
My second brain. A place for me to log everything and anything I learn with regards to my career in software.

## Goal
My goal is not necessarily to detail every page in entirety but instead to catalog terminology, concepts, products, organizations, and people I consider of note. Between the web and ChatGPT each item can easily be looked up. This helps me create relationships in my mind between all of these notes so I can not only look up a specific idea but what is related to it at a glance.

## Disclaimer
This is intended to be a brain dump of the information I have in my head so I can keep track of all the new terminology I have heard or read about. The information in this repository is what I have documented and may not be correct so don't quote me on any of the content here. I made this public since I am happy to share (^_^)

## Tools
I'm currently using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit and add to notes. Obsidian is a great tool to link note pages together.
