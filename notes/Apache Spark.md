Unified analytics engine for large scale data processing

Has more advanced analytic capability than [[Apache Hadoop]] but does not have a [[Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)]] so spark may be installed on top of [[Apache Hadoop]] to leverage its distributed file system.

Spark copies its data to [[Random Access Memory (RAM)]] which makes it faster than [[Apache Hadoop]] which takes a backup of all data onto the local server. This makes Spark more preferable when processing real time data.
