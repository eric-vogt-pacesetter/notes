Good [website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) documenting the gang of 4 design patterns.
I created a [repository of design patterns](https://github.com/ericlvogt/design-patterns) from the gang of 4 book.
Another [good repository](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) I found for design patterns with more design patterns than the gang of 4 book
