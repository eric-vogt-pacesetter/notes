#concept 
Vectors representing a different piece of data. The vector should represent the nuance of the data in a way that similar data should be close in dimensional space.

Embeddings are then fed into a [[Machine Learning (ML)]] model to make predictions.

Embeddings may be generated by a [[Neural Network (NN)]] and can be stored to save time for future use. 

For [[Large Language Models (LLM)]] embeddings could be the context of each word.
