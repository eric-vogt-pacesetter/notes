My outlook is likely heavily influenced by [[Entity Framework (EF)]]. I've also used [[SQLAlchemy]] A strategy to map database objects to entities in code. The goal is to add abstraction for database access so querying the database is passed to the ORM framework reducing coupling between code and database.
