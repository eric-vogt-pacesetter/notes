#concept
Used in [[Block Chain]] to prevent duplication of transactions from one block. It requires provers to solve a computationally heavy problem that is easily verified. It starts with a nonce and miners will generate a [[Hashing Algorithm|hash]] that statisfies a certain condition.

This is energy intensive so [[Proof of Stake (PoS)]] is an alternative that is less energy intensive
