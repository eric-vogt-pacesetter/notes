[[Data Structure]]
Similar to a [[B-Tree]] but instead each node has M number of branches. Good in cases like the English language where M=26 letters in the alphabet for word storage. Almost always larger memory than a [[B-Tree]] since each node has M number of branches but look up times can be O(1)
