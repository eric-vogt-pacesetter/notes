## SOLID
### Single-Responsibility
### Open-Closed Principle
open for extension but closed for modification
### Liskov Substitution
A class with reference to a base class can't tell the difference between the base class and an inherited class. Meaning a class must implement its base class interface.
### Interface Segregation
A class should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use
### Dependency Inversion
Depend upon abstractions not concretions. Use interfaces to avoid dependencies between classes.
